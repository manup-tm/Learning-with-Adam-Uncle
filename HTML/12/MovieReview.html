            <p>Rise Beyond could refer to the Disney movie Rise (2022), a biographical sports drama about basketball player Giannis Antetokounmpo's journey from Greece to the NBA, or it could refer to the song "Rise Beyond" by Khmer Style from the album Echoes of Tomorrow, or the short film Rise Beyond (2022) about overcoming fear. Without more context, it's hard to know which "Rise Beyond" you're asking about.</p>
