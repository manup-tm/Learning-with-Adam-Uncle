      </h3>

        Health experts have raised alarms over the growing impact of air
        pollution on public health, particularly in urban areas. According to
        recent studies, prolonged exposure to polluted air has been linked to an
        increase in respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature
        deaths.

        Dr. Alan Rivera, a pulmonologist at the National Health Institute,
        stated, “Air quality is declining in major cities, and we are seeing
        more patients with chronic breathing difficulties, even among younger
        populations.”

      <p class="text">
        Authorities are urging residents to take preventive measures such as
        wearing masks outdoors, avoiding peak traffic hours, and using air
        purifiers at home. Environmental groups have also called on governments
        to enforce stricter regulations on industrial emissions and promote
        cleaner transportation alternatives.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The report emphasizes that improving air quality is not only crucial for
        the environment but also vital for safeguarding public health for future
        generations.
