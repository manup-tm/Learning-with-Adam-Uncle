      <p>Dear Agent</p>
      <p>
        We have an emergency. The secret formula for our Mega Marshmallow has
        been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the
        fluffiest and most delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We suspect that Professor Puff is behind this. He has taken the formula
        to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and
        secure the formula before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this
        information could jeopardize the entire operation.
